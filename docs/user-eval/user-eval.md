# [User evaluation]


## 01: Login/ SignUp


### Goal

The goal of this evaluation is to assess the efficiency of the registration process within the quiz application.

### Method

To achieve the evaluation goal, we followed these steps:

**User Registration** Time: We tracked the time taken by users to complete the registration process, from entering their credentials to submitting the registration form.

Drop-Out Rate: We we estimate the drop-out rate at different stages of the registration process, aiming to identify points where users abandon the registration.

### Results

Our evaluation produced the following key results:

Average Registration Time: The average time taken by users to complete the registration process was approximately 2 minutes.

We can imagine that the drop out rate is definitely there due to our non-existent email verification. It conveys a feeling of insecurity because it is a standard process nowadays.

### Implications (Theoretically)

Based on the evaluation results, we have identified several implications for improving the registration process and user engagement:

E-Mail Verification: To address the drop-out rate at the email verification stage, we will implement user verification to ensure delivery of verification E-Mails.

Alternative Verification Methods: Based on today's standards, we could also add SMS verification, which would appeal to even more users
